# Me
Hi, I'm Li Feng, a developer interested in network, distributed sys and system programming. I mostly write Rust and C, occasionally dabbling in Python, JavaScript and C++.


# Purpose of this site
This blog is mainly used to record my learning process and share some of my personal projects. I hope to improve my writing skills and technical skills through this blog.
